# Lending Club Case Study 
The company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default and helps in identify the patterns too.

## General Information
- Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, the amount of credit loss can be reduced.

- The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
